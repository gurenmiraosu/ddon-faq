  - question: What is bounty?

      - event
    answer: Bounty event is another word for xp world quest event. Various new world quests will appear in game at certain time. The objective of the quest is simple, you kill a boss monster that reward you with massive amount of xp, then you either turn the quest in or the quest update itself. Whatever it is, the quest will also reward you with high xp. DDON main website will tell you when these quests appear (they are always in japan time). But you can always remember when they appear since they all follow the same pattern. These quests appear for only 3 hours, then they're gone for another 3 hours. After that 3 hours, they're back again for 3 hours. Basically, up time is 3 hours, and down time is 3 hours. DDON main website also list what quests are for what lvl and where to find them, but you can also do it in game -- simply check in Lestania news when bounty is up, and look for quests with red clock icon next to them. You can also talk to Area Master to find the location of these quests.
