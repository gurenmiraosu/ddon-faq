  - question: What is bounty?
    category: Open World
    tags:

      - world
      - quest
      - event
    answer: Bounty event is another word for xp world quest event. Various new Open World will appear in game at certain time. The objective of the quest is simple, you kill a boss monster that reward you with massive amount of xp, then you either turn the quest in or the quest update itself. Whatever it is, the quest will also reward you with high xp. DDON main website will tell you when these quests appear (they are always in japan time). But you can always remember when they appear since they all follow the same pattern. These quests appear for only 3 hours, then they're gone for another 3 hours. After that 3 hours, they're back again for 3 hours. Basically, up time is 3 hours, and down time is 3 hours. DDON main website also list what quests are for what lvl and where to find them, but you can also do it in game -- simply check in Lestania news when bounty is up, and look for quests with red clock icon next to them. You can also talk to Area Master to find the location of these quests.

  - question: Should I unlock core skills?

  - question: How should I progress my character Blood Orb Tree?

      - tree
      - dragon
      - arisen
      - pawn
      - damage
      - stats
    answer: Always work on the lower left / upper left portion first. After that, go for either top right for str reliant class, or lower right for mag reliant class. Remember that you need to get all nodes within the current tier to be able to get the big node at the top in the middle. Your character Blood Orb tree is extremely important mainly because it gives you AP for augment set up and also main stats for your class! All of your classes benefit from stat given by this tree, so this should be your first priority on Blood Orb spending. (Check out "How to increase your damage" topic)

    answer: >
      To start, you need to be area rank 5 in the zone that your leader is in. For each class, it is as follows:
      <br><br>
      <table class="table table-striped table-sm">
        <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Gritten Fort</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Priest</td><td>Mysree Forest</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Shield Sage</td><td>Breya Coast</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Mysree Forest</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Seeker</td><td>Dowe Valley</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Elemental Archer</td><td>Deenan Woods</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Warrior</td><td>Eastern Zandora</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Alchemist</td><td>Mergoda</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Spirit Lancer</td><td>Dana</td></tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      Next, you may have to get the "Seeking the Master" quest once you're level 18 in your given class. You may also have to do the Training Chapel quests. You can get these from Renton in the Relay Station District in the Temple.

    category: Multiplayer
    tags:
      - world
      - party
    answer: World 13. But this world is not meant <em>for</em> English speakers. Before there were "world labels", early English speaking players picked this world as their "home", but after a certain update, almost every world has a label on them.

  - question: How many pawns do I get?
    category: Temple Services
    tags:
      - pawn
      - party
      - riftstone shard
    answer: >
      You can have up to 3 main pawns and 5 hired pawns. You will not start with them all, however. To unlock them:<br>

      Pawn 1: Finish the level 5 Main Quest<br>
      Pawn 2: Give 10 Riftstone Shards to the Dragon<br>
      Pawn 3: Finish tier 3 of the Blood Orb Tree

  - question: How do I get Riftstone Shards?
    category: Open World
    tags:
      - riftstone shard
      - support goods
    answer: You can get Riftstone Shards by doing personal and Main quests, receiving them as support goods, or killing maneaters (rarely). Maneaters don't appear until level 60, and the quest rewards are few and far between, so support goods is your best bet.

  - question: What is an area rank, how do I upgrade it, and how do I get support goods from an area?
    category: Open World
    tags:
      - area rank
      - support goods
    answer: You can upgrade your area rank by doing Open World in a specific region of the world. Completing Open World gives you AP, which can increase your area rank. After getting a certain amount of AP, you can talk to the area master to rank it up. You can get your support goods from a particular area by getting them from the "View Reputation" menu, or talking to the area master in a particular region.

  - question: My character has a debuff called "Weakness", what is it and how do I get rid of it?
    category: Temple Services
    tags:
      - weakness
      - dying
      - revival gem
    answer: Weakness is a penalty for dying without using a revival gem. It will lower all of your stats, and it lasts for 15 minutes. If you don't want to wait 15 minutes, you can "Treat Weakness" at an Inn. The more often you "Treat Weakness", however, the higher it will cost.

  - question: How do I get more revival gems?
    category: Temple Services
    tags:
      - dying
      - revival gem
    answer: You can visit Ophelia in the Temple once per day (resetting with the daily reset). She will refill you back up to 3 revival gems. If you have a Passport Course, you can refill this an unlimited number of times per day.
